This is a web application developed to help recommend SHL assessments based on a candidate's attributes. The app allows users to upload data, analyze it, and get recommendations for suitable assessments based on their characteristics.

Features
Upload CSV: Users can upload a CSV file containing candidate data.

Assessment Recommendations: Based on the input data, the app suggests SHL assessments that align with the candidateâ€™s characteristics.

Visualization: It provides a clear view of the data and recommendations using Streamlit's interactive UI.

Technologies Used
Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web apps.

pandas: Data analysis and manipulation library.

scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building models (used for making predictions).

matplotlib: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
